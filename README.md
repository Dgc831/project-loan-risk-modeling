This project explores a large dataset of loan applications from a financial institution. The goal was to understand the characteristics of loan applicants, identify patterns among clients who defaulted, and use regression analysis to explore the potential for predicting default risk. The project involved data cleaning, handling missing values and outliers, generating client demographic insights, and building visualizations to support executive decision-making.
